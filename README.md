# Shr.UniversalZipCodeValidator

The validation of the country zip codes and email addresses from user interfaces is a common problem scenario for multiple applications. 
Since Enterprise applications have global audience from most of the countries where they do business, there is a need to have a common place which applications can rely on for zip validations and not replicate this logic all over.

This library tries to address that.
